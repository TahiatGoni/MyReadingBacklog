# My Reading Backlog
I spend a lot of time on sites like daily.dev to keep up with tech. I find myself opening so many tabs or bookmarking items that I never get to. So, I decided to create an application that can help me store links to all the articles I want to read. 

"Big deal! How is it any different from saving bookmarks?". 
I want to make this a terminal application that will show me my stats on startup. These stats will include how many articles I have added to my list, how many I have read already.
If it keeps popping up everytime I open a terminal, it will remind me to open up and read an article from time to time.
I want to be able to read an article in first in first out method or get a random article to read from my list.

MyReadingBacklog is a work in progress. It is intended to be a terminal application where you can store links to articles you want to read from the web.

### Core features
- Save links to articles into a queue.
- Get articles from the queue in FIFO order.
- Get random articles from the queue.
- Get stats on how many articles you have read and how many you have added to your list.
- On opening a terminal, show these stats to the user.

### Potential Additional features
- Add a category read feature to organize my articles and read from certain categories.
- Might be clumsy to manually add articles through the terminal, so research some UX improvements.
